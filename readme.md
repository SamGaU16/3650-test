Tensorflow Keras was the library used to training the model.
OpenCV (cv2) was used for reading the images.
The dataset was mold to halve the pixels.
The model:
- Uses two convolution 2D layers, each have a 'Max Pooling' operation.
- Uses a Flattens and two Dense layers, the last one for normalize the output.
- Has an early stop for overfitting.
- Has a validation set made up of about 15% of the training data.
- Was exported as 'model_savestate.h5'.
